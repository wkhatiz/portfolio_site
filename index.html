            <h3>Experiences</h3>
            <p>
                I studied at Western Sydney University for a Bachelor of Computer Science where I learned the fundamentals of programming and computer science.
                During my university experience I was given the oppurtunity to do some volunteer work for IBM Chicago creating the interface for a mobile application using React Native.
                After graduating I received a position at Infosys and went into a career in software testing doing both functional 
                and non-functional testing on web applications using tools such as JMeter and Robot Framework to write scripts simulating user activity.

            <h3>Skills</h3>
            <p>
                I've built a strong foundation of fundamental programming principles having started programming on low-level strongly typed languages
                before moving into web development. My first web projects were built using vanilla HTML/CSS/JS before I gradually began utilizing
                development tools such as React, React Native, Android Studio, etc. Through my academic experience and personal projects I have a strong 
                grasp of concepts such as Object Oriented Programming, Data Structures and Algorithms, Inclusive Design, Database Management Systems, 
                Systems Programming, etc.

                    This is a wordle game created using Next/React. <br/> The background is generated dynamically using 
                    the Unsplash API using the Next getServerSideProps function. <br/>
                    The game uses Next API routes to implement the logic for generating a random word, getting the 
                    corresponding colors for each guess, and returning the correct answer at the end of the game. <br/> Session 
                    data such as the session id and corresponding correct answer, is stored in a Firebase Firestore DB.

                    Town Hall station is currently a mess of connecting buildings, diverging paths and multiple unmarked exits leading to 
                    busy streets. The goal of this web app is to map out all the possible exits out of Town Hall Station.
                    I am using React Native to complete the first build which is just a POC mapping out only the station itself. Following
                    releases will expand the scope to the adjoining buildings.
